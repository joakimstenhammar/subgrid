three-dimensional, fifteen-velocity model. The collision operator has
three relaxation times (shear, bulk and non-hydrodynamic, the last
being projected out at every timestep), as set out in Nash et
al. (DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevE.77.026709). Thermal fluctuations are also
incorporated with the method of Adhikari et al. (DOI:
